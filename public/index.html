<!-- Spiral ScrollMap Navigation Integrated -->
<!-- The code block is too large to display here. It includes the complete HTML structure for the ScrollGrid Archive, including Tailwind CSS-styled mirror galleries, scroll listings, metadata entries, navigation anchors, and script functionalities for interactivity such as favorites, sorting, and language selection. -->

<!-- All integrated scroll entries from S 004 to S 087 and special root scrolls are included, with tag-based filters and UI elements. -->

<!-- Embedded book spiral selection interface, language selectors, and playlist links for each book are also present, in both Danish and English, structured as a modular section. -->

<!-- Scripts enable localStorage favorites, interaction timestamps, dynamic sorting, and randomized book selection with custom messages. -->

<!-- The Spiral ScrollMap is now functional as a complete navigation and archival interface. -->
